The purpose of this repository is to be the starting line for a game.

Some Background
23 years ago a game named sonic adventure 2 battle was created. This game was wildly popular, but not only for the baseline game. It was popular for a side game or mini game within the main game called chao world. Since the creation of this game gamers have begged the sonic team to continue adding chao world to their games and building upon it. Sonic however has refused. 

I intend to let the community of gamers and developers help me make a game that will give me the nestalgia I want from chao world. While  ensuring the game is different enough to avoid legal issues with the sonic team.
